# handdetection-canva
using media pipe that already has already been trained on various hand images to have different and have hand landmarks we will detect the hand and make the computer screen accessible using our hand.

The MediaPipe Hands module identifies 21 key landmarks on each hand. These landmarks correspond to specific points on the hand, such as finger joints and the wrist. Here's a list of the 21 hand landmarks and their corresponding locations:

WRIST: The base of the palm.

THUMB_TIP: The tip of the thumb.
INDEX_FINGER_MCP: The Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the index finger.
INDEX_FINGER_PIP: The Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the index finger.
INDEX_FINGER_DIP: The Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the index finger.
INDEX_FINGER_TIP: The tip of the index finger.
MIDDLE_FINGER_MCP: The Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the middle finger.
MIDDLE_FINGER_PIP: The Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the middle finger.
MIDDLE_FINGER_DIP: The Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the middle finger.
MIDDLE_FINGER_TIP: The tip of the middle finger.
RING_FINGER_MCP: The Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the ring finger.
RING_FINGER_PIP: The Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the ring finger.
RING_FINGER_DIP: The Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint of the ring finger.
RING_FINGER_TIP: The tip of the ring finger.
PINKY_MCP: The Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the pinky finger.
